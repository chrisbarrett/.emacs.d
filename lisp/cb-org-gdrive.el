;;; Commentary:

;; Provides commands for uploading and importing documents into Google Drive,
;; along with an org exporter. Requires the `gdrive' program.
;;
;;   https://github.com/prasmussen/gdrive
;;
;; The org ODT exporter is used to create an intermediate document, which is
;; uploaded to Drive and converted to a Google Doc.

;;; Installation:

;; Install this package and add the following to your Emacs config:
;;
;;   (add-hook 'org-mode-hook #'cb-org-gdrive-init)
;;
;; Below is an appropriate `use-package' form:
;;
;;   (use-package cb-org-gdrive
;;     :after org
;;     :config
;;     (add-hook 'org-mode-hook #'cb-org-gdrive-init))
