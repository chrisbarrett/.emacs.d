    "Change the TODO state of an item.

The state of an item is given by a keyword at the start of the heading,
like
     *** TODO Write paper
     *** DONE Call mom

The different keywords are specified in the variable `org-todo-keywords'.
By default the available states are \"TODO\" and \"DONE\".  So, for this
example: when the item starts with TODO, it is changed to DONE.
When it starts with DONE, the DONE is removed.  And when neither TODO nor
DONE are present, add TODO at the beginning of the heading.
You can set up single-charcter keys to fast-select the new state.  See the
`org-todo-keywords' and `org-use-fast-todo-selection' for details.

With `\\[universal-argument]' prefix ARG, force logging the state change \
and take a
logging note.
With a `\\[universal-argument] \\[universal-argument]' prefix, switch to the \
next set of TODO \
keywords (nextset).
Another way to achieve this is `S-C-<right>'.
With a `\\[universal-argument] \\[universal-argument] \\[universal-argument]' \
prefix, circumvent any state blocking.
With numeric prefix arg, switch to the Nth state.

With a numeric prefix arg of 0, inhibit note taking for the change.
With a numeric prefix arg of -1, cancel repeater to allow marking as DONE.

When called through ELisp, arg is also interpreted in the following way:
`none'        -> empty state
\"\"            -> switch to empty state
`done'        -> switch to DONE
`nextset'     -> switch to the next set of keywords
`previousset' -> switch to the previous set of keywords
\"WAITING\"     -> switch to the specified keyword, but only if it
                 really is a member of `org-todo-keywords'."
