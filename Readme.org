#+TITLE: Emacs Config

My personal Emacs configuration. It's a chonker.

* Installation
Nix is used to build an Emacs with 3rd-party packages pre-installed.

#+begin_src sh
  nix-build
  ./result/bin/emacs
#+end_src

The derivation can be imported into a NixOS or home-manager configuration using
the usual mechanisms. Doing this would allow you to add this Emacs to your Nix
profile for normal use.

#+begin_src nix
  { pkgs, ... }:
  {
    nixpkgs.overlays = [
      (self: super:
      {
        emacsCustom = builtins.fetchTarball rec {
          rev = "master";
          url = "https://github.com/chrisbarrett/.emacs.d/archive/${rev}.tar.gz";
        };
      })
    ];

    home.packages = [
      # Installs to ~/.nix-profile/bin/{emacs,emacsclient}
      pkgs.emacsCustom
    ];
  }
#+end_src
