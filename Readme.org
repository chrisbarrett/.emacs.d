#+TITLE: Emacs Config

My personal Emacs configuration. It's a chonker.

I don't recommend anyone else actually uses this as-is since it's a personal
setup that I change regularly.

* Setup
[[https://nixos.org/][Nix]] is used to build an Emacs along with 3rd-party Lisp packages and required
programs on its path. It should be sufficient to install a recent Nix that has
Flake support to get this running.

#+begin_src sh
  nix run
#+end_src

* Nix Flake Usage
To integrate this with your system configuration, pull in the Flake and consume
the appropriate output package for your system.

The example below is for nix-darwin; a NixOS configuration would look very
similar.

#+begin_src nix
  {
    description = "Example flake using custom Emacs build";

    # NB. You could use a local checkout instead: "dir:/path/to/checkout"
    inputs.emacs.url = "github:chrisbarrett/.emacs.d";

    outputs = { self, emacs, home-manager, nix-darwin }: {
      # e.g. ...
      darwinConfiguration.testMachine =
        let system = "aarch64-darwin";
        in
        nix-darwin.lib.darwinSystem {
          inherit system;

          modules = [
            home-manager.darwinModules.home-manager
          ];

          nixpkgs.overlays = [ emacs.overlays."${system}".default ];

          home-manager = {
            users.hello = { pkgs, ... }: {
              home.packages = [
                pkgs.emacsCustom
              ];
            };
          };
        };
    };
  }
#+end_src
